This program is a simple version of the Flappy Bird game created using Java Swing. In the game, you control a bird that must fly between pipes without hitting them. 
The bird starts at rest, but when you press the space bar, it flaps upwards. If you donâ€™t press the space bar again, gravity pulls the bird down. The goal is to avoid 
crashing into the pipes or the ground and to keep the bird flying as long as possible. The game shows your score, which increases each time the bird successfully passes through 
a pipe. If you crash, the game ends, and you can restart it to try again.

On the left-hand side of the game screen, there is a progress bar that shows the bird's position in the game. This progress bar helps you track how far the bird has flown, making it 
easier to position the bird to navigate through the pipes. It gives you a better sense of control over the bird's movement, helping you time your flaps and avoid obstacles. If the bird 
crashes into a pipe or the ground, the game ends, and a game-over screen appears with a restart button. You can click the restart button to begin a new game with a score of 0.
